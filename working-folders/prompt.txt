awesome that works....now I need to make the following changes. 
1. Very important. This layout should be mobile screen only. So please set the max width to a mobile phone screen size. When the user  opens this in browser, it shows this app centered in the screen with max width as per a mobile phone. When the user opens this in mobile, it shows as a app fitting the mobile screen. App should open with location permission is not already available.

2. Do not show the map on the app. Show only the listing. Open the map when the user clicks directions.

3. Show each place/listing as a card. There is one card per row take 96% width. Card listing have vertical scrolling. See the uploaded card.jpg for the layout.

4. Each card should contain the following information
* Restaurant Name
* Distance from user location, use the units as set in the users device locale.
* Hours info, is it open and when it will close
* Google review stars

5. Card layout is somewhat like this, as shown in the attached card.jpg

--------------------------------------------------
Name of the restarant					distance
Address
Hours
Reviews							Directions Button
--------------------------------------------------

6. App colors:
* Use the following colors in random as the background of each card. #784e5c, #43a17f, #bd69ff, #fa639a, #3fb1e5, a18dc2
* All the cards have the same border value: 6px solid #4d116d, radius: 8px
* App background: #f0ffca
* Directions-Button backgroud: #ae0c0c
* Directions-button-border: 4px solid #7c0000

8. The app logo is attached: app-logo.jpg

9. When the user scrolls the card, the logo should be visible at all times, fixed on top.

10. Set this code to find "Biriyani Near Me"
